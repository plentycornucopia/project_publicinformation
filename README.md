Project: Public Information

We need to store all **public information** records on our personal budget from month to month. We want to store them in a Postgres DB with the following column structure:

|Reference|Report Date|Group|ChesterPA|AllenTX|AtlantaGA|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|*VARCHAR(9)|*MM/DD/YYYY|VARCHAR(3)|VARCHAR(255)|VARCHAR(255)|VARCHAR(255)|

* From month to month we will not know how many inquiry records we'll have. Could be 1. Could 30. Could be 0.
* If 0, no record should be created. If â‰¤1, then create the corresponding record(s) in the DB.

*must always be present

**may sometimes be blank

***postgres db available upon request

## Table Selector
`#PublicInformation > ng > div:nth-child(1) > table` (this selector will only exist if there are public records available)
